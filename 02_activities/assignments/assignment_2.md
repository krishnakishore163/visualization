# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.

      Your answer...
1. Good Visualization: Seeking Safety - European Asylum Application Flows
  Link: [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2015/05/12/seeking-safety)

1.1 Clear Display: Clearly identifies the major countries of asylum applicants.

1.2 Acceptance and Rejection Ratios: Displays success rates for each country transparently.

1.3 Explicit Proportions: Enables intuitive comparisons with clear proportions.

1.4 Annual Comparison: Facilitates the comparison of asylum data between 2012 and 2014 to observe trends.

Summary: The visualization offers a clear and intuitive perspective on the major applicant countries, their acceptance and rejection ratios, and allows for effective year-to-year comparisons. Its strengths lie in its vivid representation and insightful data comparisons.

2. Bad Visualization: Foreigners in Milan
  Link: [flickr.com](https://www.flickr.com/photos/densitydesign/8089717433/in/album-72157631774207511/)

  Description: The map shows foreign residents in Milan, with balloon size indicating population and color representing the percentage of foreigners.

  Issues:

 2.1 Information Overload: The map is overcrowded with numerous balloons of different sizes, which increases cognitive load and hampers the effective interpretation and analysis of the data.

2.2 Increased Cognitive Load: The balloon size represents the number of people instead of the percentage of foreigners. Consequently, a balloon indicating 7.5% might be larger than one showing 8.9%, causing confusion between balloon size and the displayed percentage of foreigners.

2.3 Lack of Geographic Detail: The map oversimplifies geographic features, omitting important contextual details such as streets and landmarks. Despite the abundance of balloons, the simplified map lacks essential geographic context, hindering the understanding of data distribution in relation to real-world locations.

    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      Your answer...
1. Good Visualization:

 1.1 Clarify Label: The total asylum decisions for 2012 and 2014 do not align with the sum of accepted and rejected decisions, causing confusion. To address this, provide a breakdown of application numbers and their percentages for major countries.

1.2 Simplify Comparison: Changing the country order between 2012 and 2014 makes data comparison harder, increasing cognitive load. To facilitate easier and more accurate comparison, keep the country order consistent across years.

1.3 Add Data Source: Including the data source boosts credibility and allows users to verify the information, fostering greater trust and understanding of the visualization.

2. Bad Visualization:

  2.1 Simplify Visualization: Reduce information density by merging similar areas and decreasing the number of bubbles. Display only major regions or use aggregated bubbles to minimize visual clutter, making the map easier to understand.

2.2 Faceted Plot: Use multiple small plots to show data for different regions. Divide the map into administrative or regional areas, with each small plot displaying the proportion of foreigners and total population. This approach helps avoid information overload and allows for more detailed comparisons.

2.3 Stacked Bar Chart: Add a stacked bar chart next to the map to display the proportion of foreigners in each region. This additional chart provides an extra layer of information, helping users better understand the data and compare it with the map information.






      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
